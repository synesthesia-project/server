 * looked-up. Only active objects can be requested by their hash, or have their hash
 * value returned. When the active objects are updated, only those that are new need
 * to have their hash computed.
 *
 * The objects passed must not be mutated, as their hash is calculated based on their
 * contents, and assumed not to change.
 *
 * (This is primarily used for calculating the hashes and allowing for hash lookups of CueFiles).
